Description:
myShell is written in C. It takes in commands from the users as input, or as input from a batchfile. Can run any of the
built-in commands or can run other non-builtin commands using forking and executing.

Built-In Commands:

Command			Description

cd			cd <directory name> allows for the current working directory to change

clr			clr command will clear the screen on the terminal that is running the shell

dir			dir <directory name> will list all items currently in the directory that the user
			is currently on, subdirectories or files

environ			environ will list all the environment variables for the directory

echo			echo <user input> will print the string for all arguments after "echo" as a new string
			with each line.

help			help command will display the MANFILE. Listing all the commands as well as a brief description
			of each function, describing its implementation and how it works

pause			pause command will pause the shell prompting the user over and over again until they
			hit the enter key

quit			quit will exit the shell, giving a message at the end at termination

Background Execution (&):
	When executing a command normally, the parent process will create a child process, start executing, 
	but it will wait for the child process to terminate. In the case of a background process, it will
	begin the same way but the parent process will not wait for the child process to finish. 

Example of background execution:
	/Thaldrin/Desktop/Shell> <command> <process to run in background> &

Piping:
	Pipe uses send & blocking receive operations. Pipes follow the FIFO queue style, and allow the suer to 
	pass file contents to a command. Pipes allow the user to move information between different parameters
	and chain things together.

Redirection:
	The shell also supports input/output redirection. If the user types < filename or > filename, the stdin
	and stdout of the shell will change for the current process. Input/output will then come from/go to a file
